I am going to see what are the things missing and what more can be refactored to make
this project complete.
```yarn hardhat coverage``` :- through this we can see the code coverage, 
like for how much code, we have written test for.

```yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js``` through this we are deploying our
contract on the local network.
We are also Verifying our contract here with the help of etherscan api key.
*First we are getting the contractFactory from the ethers.
*Then we are getting the contract from the factory.
*Then we are deploying the contract.

```yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten``` through this we are deploying our
to testnet ropsten.

Now I am going to write the necessary tests.

Now, I have written all the unit tests for this SimpleStorage contract.
Now, I am going to write the deploy script and wrap.
